# email-beautifier
## v0.0.1

This program adds random styles to an email to make it more fun to read. Enjoy!

To do:
* Add more fonts
* Add random effects per word / similar characters: wave, color gradient, size gradient (in this case with uniform background)
* Add random .upper() / .lower() effects
* Add random line- and character-spacing options
* Separate full-stops and other characters as separators instead of them being part of words
* Split the lines along all line separators!
* Process tabs (\t) and other special characters accurately
* Rearrange the Char object to make the random generator function intrinsic
* Compute the color gradient manually (in 3D RGB space)
